1 - Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?
    We only need to set up the react-testing-library Jest with npm install

2 - What components are worth to test in your development?
    Currently the only components that are worth to test in the current development are the navigation bar with
    the search bar and the video display list

3 - Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
    You can apply TDD creating the tests first and making them fail. Then create the components to make the tests pass and the last step is to refactor the
    necessary code.
    If you create the component first it might not cover all the possible scenarios because the component could miss some test cases.
    In any case you can create the component first and then apply TDD but it is preferable to do it the other way.
